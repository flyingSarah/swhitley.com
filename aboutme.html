			<p>This is my website where you can get to know me professionally! I am currently based in Berlin, Germany, 
			but I lived and worked for many years in the San Francisco Bay Area in California (there I went by my maiden 
			name, Sarah Howe). Iâ€™m a video artist and a self-taught software developer, specializing in C++. I went to 
			school for Music Technology at the California Institute of the Arts and then went to Mills College to acquire 
			an MFA in Electronic Music and Recording Media. Going to institutions heavily focused on the arts while 
			majoring in a very technology oriented field, naturally lead me to my other interests in software development 
			and video art. Check out my software and video pages to learn more about me and what I do.
