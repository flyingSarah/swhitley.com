      <p>This will soon be a page describing software projects that I'm working on, check out my GitHub profile in the meantime (see link in top right corner). Also, here is a quick description of my programming background:
      </p>
      <p>My interests in software development began to percolate while studying Music Technology in college. Through the use of media software like Max/MSP and Isadora, which expose what goes on under the hood of music and video processing via their modular, visual programming environment, I gained a greater understanding of the mechanisms at work that go into making the creative software that I so love to use.
      </p>
      <p>After grad school I started working at a company that makes tools for electronic musicians where I began developing software that allows users to customize the behavior of MIDI controllers and audio mixers. I take advantage of every opportunity I can to soak up knowledge of modern programming practices and I take on many personal projects to help me learn (including this website). I love to experiment with different languages and technologies: mainly using C++ within the Qt framework, QML and Processing for a couple of new personal projects, and Swift and Xcode to get my feet wet in iOS development.
